                <h1 class="title">Devastation of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill</h1>
                <p class="description">
                    On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig, operating in the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, experienced a catastrophic explosion. This disaster resulted in the death of 11 workers and led to the largest marine oil spill in history. Over 4 million barrels of oil were released into the Gulf, impacting marine life and local communities. The spill lasted for 87 days, only being capped on July 15, 2010.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The U.S. government filed a lawsuit against BP Exploration & Production and other parties responsible for the spill. This resulted in record-setting penalties, including a $5.5 billion Clean Water Act penalty and up to $8.8 billion in damages for natural resources. This page outlines the EPA’s enforcement response and provides information about the ongoing effects and legal actions related to the spill.
